// Create a program to find the Least Common Multiple(LCM) of two numbers.

//ðŸ”¹Definition of LCM:-

// LCM(Least Common Multiple) of two numbers is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of both numbers.
// ðŸ‘‰ In other words, it is the smallest number that both given numbers can divide exactly without leaving a remainder.

      // Explanation of logic:-

      // --> Loop starts from max and goes up to m *n(worst case, where LCM is the product of the numbers).

      // --> break; ensures we stop at the first(smallest) such number.
