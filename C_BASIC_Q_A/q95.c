// Create a program that uses malloc to dynamically allocate an array for a specified number of float values entered by the user and then stores user-entered numbers into it.

/*
--> What is Dynamic Memory Allocation in C ?

      In C, Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) means allocating memory to variables at runtime (when the program is running) instead of at compile time.

      ðŸ‘‰ Normally, when you declare variables like this:
      int arr[10];   // fixed memory for 10 integers

      The size is fixed and cannot change during execution.

      But what if you donâ€™t know in advance how much memory you will need?
      This is where Dynamic Memory Allocation comes in.
      It allows you to request memory from the heap during program execution.
