// Use calloc to allocate an array for a set of char characters representing a sentence, ensuring all the memory is initialized to zero.

--> What is Dynamic Memory Allocation in C ?

      In C, Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) means allocating memory to variables at runtime (when the program is running) instead of at compile time.

      ðŸ‘‰ Normally, when you declare variables like this:
      int arr[10];   // fixed memory for 10 integers

      The size is fixed and cannot change during execution.

      But what if you donâ€™t know in advance how much memory you will need?
      This is where Dynamic Memory Allocation comes in.
      It allows you to request memory from the heap during program execution.

      ---------------------------------------------------
      Difference between malloc() and calloc():
            - malloc(): Allocates memory but leaves it uninitialized (garbage values).
            - calloc(): Allocates memory AND initializes all bytes to 0.

      // Step 2: Check if memory allocation was successful
      if (ptr == NULL)

            printf("\nMemory Not Allocated Successfully!\n");
            return 1; // Exit the program if allocation failed

      {
            printf("\nMemory Allocated Successfully!\n");

      printf("\nDefault Memory Initialization (first 20 values shown):\n");
      for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) // printing only first 20 for clarity
      {
            printf("%d ", ptr[i]); // will print 0s
      }
      printf("...\n");

      // Step 4: Take a string input from the user
      printf("\nEnter a sentence (less than 100 characters): ");
      scanf(" %99[^\n]", ptr); // %99[^\n] prevents overflow & reads spaces

      // Step 5: Print the entered string
      printf("\nEntered Sentence: %s.\n", ptr);

      // Step 6: Free the allocated memory
      free(ptr);
      printf("\nMemory Freed Successfully.\n\n");
