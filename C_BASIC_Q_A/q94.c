/*
--> What is Dynamic Memory Allocation in C ?

      In C, Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) means allocating memory to variables at runtime (when the program is running) instead of at compile time.

      ðŸ‘‰ Normally, when you declare variables like this:
      int arr[10];   // fixed memory for 10 integers

      The size is fixed and cannot change during execution.

      But what if you donâ€™t know in advance how much memory you will need?
      This is where Dynamic Memory Allocation comes in.
      It allows you to request memory from the heap during program execution.

#include <string.h> // Header file required for string hadling functions such as strcpy(), strlen(), etc.
#include <stdlib.h> // Header file required for dynamic memory allocation by using malloc(), calloc(), etc.

/*
--> What is a Structure in C?
      A structure in C is a user-defined data type that allows you to group different types of related data together under a single name. Think of it like a box that can hold multiple items of different types (like int, float, char, etc.) but all belonging to the same entity.

      SYNTAX:-

      struct StructureName
      {
            data_type member1;
            data_type member2;
            data_type member3;
            ...
      };
