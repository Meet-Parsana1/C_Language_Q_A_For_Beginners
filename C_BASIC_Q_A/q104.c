// Create a program that performs both reading and writing operations on a file called data.txt

/*
ðŸ“‚ What is File Handling in C?

ðŸ‘‰ File Handling in C means storing data in files permanently on your computerâ€™s hard drive
and then being able to read, write, update, or delete that data whenever needed.

Normally, variables in C store data in RAM (temporary memory). Once the program ends, all data is lost.
But with File Handling, data is stored in a file (like .txt, .dat, etc.) on disk â†’ so it remains saved
even after the program ends.

ðŸ”‘ Why Use File Handling?
- Data Permanence â†’ Data stays saved even after program closes.
- Large Data Handling â†’ You can store thousands of records (not possible with just variables).
- Data Sharing â†’ Files can be opened and shared by other programs too.

ðŸ“Œ File Handling Functions in C
- fopen()  â†’ Open a file (create if it doesnâ€™t exist).
- fprintf() â†’ Write formatted data into a file.
- fscanf() â†’ Read formatted data from a file.
- fputs() / fputc() â†’ Write a string/character into a file.
- fgets() / fgetc() â†’ Read a string/character from a file.
- fclose() â†’ Close an opened file.
- fseek(), ftell(), rewind() â†’ Move the file pointer for random access.

ðŸ“Œ File Modes in C (used in fopen)
- "r" â†’ Open file for reading (file must exist).
- "w" â†’ Open file for writing (creates new file or erases existing file).
- "a" â†’ Open file for appending (data is added at the end).
- "r+" â†’ Open file for both reading & writing.
- "w+" â†’ Open file for reading & writing (creates new file, erases old).
- "a+" â†’ Open file for reading & appending.

      {
            // If the file cannot be opened
            printf("\nError while opening the file.\n");

            printf("%s", fileContent);
      }

      // Reset file pointer to the beginning before writing
      rewind(file);

      // Get user input
      char text[100];
      printf("\n\nEnter the text you want to write in the file: ");
      fgets(text, sizeof(text), stdin);

      // Write new text into the file (overwrites from beginning)
      fprintf(file, "%s", text);

      // Close the file
      fclose(file);

      printf("\nText written successfully in the file and file closed.\n\n");
