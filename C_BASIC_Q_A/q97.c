// Allocate memory for a struct representing a Point with x and y coordinates, set some values, and then properly deallocate the memory using free.

--> What is Dynamic Memory Allocation in C ?

      In C, Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) means allocating memory to variables at runtime (when the program is running) instead of at compile time.

      ðŸ‘‰ Normally, when you declare variables like this:
      int arr[10];   // fixed memory for 10 integers

      The size is fixed and cannot change during execution.

      But what if you donâ€™t know in advance how much memory you will need?
      This is where Dynamic Memory Allocation comes in.
      It allows you to request memory from the heap during program execution.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // Header file required for dynamic memory allocation by using malloc(), calloc(), etc.

/*
--> What is a Structure in C?
      A structure in C is a user-defined data type that allows you to group different types of related data together under a single name. Think of it like a box that can hold multiple items of different types (like int, float, char, etc.) but all belonging to the same entity.

      SYNTAX:-

      struct StructureName
      {
            data_type member1;
            data_type member2;
            data_type member3;
            ...
      };
*/

// Step 1: Define a structure for coordinates
struct Coordinates
{
      float X;
      float Y;
};

int main()
{
      // Step 2: Allocate memory dynamically for one struct Coordinates
      struct Coordinates *Point = (struct Coordinates *)malloc(sizeof(struct Coordinates));
      // Alternative (initializes memory with 0s):
      // struct Coordinates *Point = (struct Coordinates *)calloc(1, sizeof(struct Coordinates));

      // Step 3: Check if memory allocation was successful
      if (Point == NULL)
      {
            printf("\nMemory Not Allocated!\n");
            return 1; // Exit the program if allocation fails
      }
      else
      {
            printf("\nMemory Allocated Successfully!\n");
      }

      // Step 4: Assign values to the structure members using pointer (-> operator)
      Point->X = 12.2;
      Point->Y = 13.3;

      // Step 5: Display the values
      printf("\nX-coordinate: %.2f\nY-coordinate: %.2f\n", Point->X, Point->Y);

      // Step 6: Free the dynamically allocated memory
      free(Point);
      printf("\nMemory Freed Successfully!\n\n");

      return 0; // End of program
